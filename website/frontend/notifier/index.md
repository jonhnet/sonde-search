Not many of of the radiosondes in my area (Seattle) land somewhere
accessible; most end up in the forest or the ocean. Rather than having
to check [SondeHub](https://www.sondehub.org/") twice a day, I set up
a system that would query SondeHub's API for me and send me an email
if a radiosonde landed nearby. Eventually I opened it up to anyone to
use.
