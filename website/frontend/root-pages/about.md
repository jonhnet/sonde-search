Hi! My name is [Jeremy](https://www.circlemud.org/jelson), and
Lectrobox is a tiny company I made for fun in order to distribute some
of my electronics projects. I work for a Big Company as a computer
scientist by day. But after work, I have a lot of hobbies I'm
passionate about: being a maker, riding bicycles, flying small
airplanes, and travelling.  A few years ago, I realized that some of
my electronics projects might be useful to other people, too! And so
<em>Lectrobox</em> was born.

Most of my electronics are designed and prototyped at my home in
Seattle. The first few copies of everything I sell are made by
hand. After those are gone, I hire companies to do the bulk assembly
for me. This lets me spend more time designing the next cool thing and
less time soldering.

Nearly everything I sell is distributed through Amazon's fulfillment
services. I just ship a box full of my products to Amazon; they store
it in their warehouse and ship it when someone orders one. This is
great for a micro-company like mine because it keeps me from having to
be on call every day to ship boxes out to customers or deal with
taking orders: Amazon makes it all turn-key.

If you have any suggestions for new projects or would like to
collaborate, please get in touch with me at <em>jelson</em> at
