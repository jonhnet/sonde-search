A [radiosonde](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/upperair/radiosondes) is
a small wireless sensor used to gather data about the atmosphere to
drive weather predictions and research. At over 1,300 sites worldwide,
sondes are launched twice a day, hoisted by large hydrogen-filled
balloons into the upper atmosphere. Over the course of several hours,
they climb up above 100,000 feet (30,000 meters).

When the balloon finally bursts, the sonde falls slowly back to earth
under a small parachute. That's where our hobby begins! Hobbyists
around the world collaborate to [track the
sondes](https://www.sondehub.org/) and find them after they land.
Once every second, the sonde transmits data including its current
GPS-derived position (latitude, longitude and altitude) back to the
launch point. These transmissions are not encrypted, and hobbyists
have learned to receive and decode them, typically with a cheap
[software-defined radio](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/).

The [SondeHub](https://www.sondehub.org) web site is the largest
public repository of radiosonde data collected by hobbyists. Over the
past couple of years, I've built a number of tools that help track
radiosondes based on the data from SondeHub. My site makes all those
tools available to the public. You can also find all [the source
code](https://github.com/jonhnet/sonde-search) on GitHub.

You may still be wondering: but *why* search for sondes?

Why not? It's fun. It's like a high-tech treasure hunt, similar to
[Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com).
