A [radiosonde](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/upperair/radiosondes) is
a small wireless sensor used to gather data about the atmosphere to
drive weather predictions and research. At over 1,300 sites worldwide,
sondes are launched twice a day, hoisted by large hydrogen-filled
balloons into the upper atmosphere. Over the course of several hours,
they climb up above 100,000 feet (30,000 meters).

When the balloon bursts, the sonde falls slowly back to Earth under a
small parachute. That's where our hobby begins! Sonde-hunting
enthusiasts around the world collaborate to [track the
sondes](https://www.sondehub.org/) and find them after they land.
Every second, the devices transmit data back to their launch point,
including their current GPS-derived position (latitude, longitude and
altitude). These transmissions are not encrypted, so hobbyists have
learned to receive and decode them, typically with a cheap
[software-defined
radio](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/). Volunteers have set up
hundreds of listening posts worldwide.

[SondeHub](https://www.sondehub.org) is the largest public repository
of radiosonde data collected by hobbyists. Over the past couple of
years, I've built a number of tools that help track radiosondes based
on the data from SondeHub. My site makes all those tools available to
the public. You can also find all [the source
code](https://github.com/jonhnet/sonde-search) on GitHub.

You may still be wondering: but *why* search for sondes?

Why not? It's fun. It's like a high-tech treasure hunt, similar to
[Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com).
